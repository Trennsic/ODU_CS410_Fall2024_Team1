I’m a senior pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I work as a data center technician at Old Dominion University, maintaining a safe, secure, and scalable server-cloud infrastructure. I perform software and hardware troubleshooting while maintaining clear and concise ticket-based record-keeping. Previously, I managed a team of 40 in the service industry and spend my free time honing my craft by programming personal software projects. I’m proficient in C#, C++, Java, Python, and ActionScript.
